Augment just finished syncing with your codebase! Here is a summary of what we saw:

Based on the codebase information, this appears to be a Rust project called "json-diff" that's in its early stages of development.

The project:

Is set up with Cargo (Rust's package manager)
Currently only contains a basic "Hello, world!" implementation
Has version 0.1.0
Uses Rust edition 2024
Has a standard Rust project structure with src/main.rs as the entry point
The name "json-diff" suggests it's likely intended to be a tool for comparing and identifying differences between JSON files or objects, though the actual implementation hasn't been started yet beyond the initial project setup.

Here are some questions you can ask Augment:

Try to impliment base on README.md

Based on the README.md, I'll implement a basic structure for the JSON diff tool. Let's start by setting up the main components and dependencies.

First, let's update the Cargo.toml file to include necessary dependencies:

Now, let's create the basic structure for our project:

src
Now let's create the compare module:

Base on the README.md, design a formet to store diffs of 2 json files. It's better to be text based and can mange the history with version control systems like git. Add document of the file format

Based on the README.md, here's a simple text-based format for storing JSON diffs that would work well with version control systems:

docs
This format provides:

A clear header with metadata about the comparison
Simple prefix symbols to indicate the type of difference
JSONPath notation to precisely locate changes
Human-readable representation of the changes
Plain text format that works well with git and other VCS
Support for all the features mentioned in the README (ignoring fields, unordered array comparison)
The format is easy to parse programmatically but also readable for humans reviewing diffs.

implement the json compare module. You can make the current repo a workspace and add json compare module as a library under the workspece

I'll implement the JSON compare module as a library in a Cargo workspace. First, let's set up the workspace structure:

Loading...
Now, let's create the core library for JSON comparison:

json-diff-core
json-diff-core/src
json-diff-core/src
json-diff-core/src
impl fmt::Display for DiffEntry {    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>)         match self.diff_type {            DiffType::Modified |                 write!(f, "{} -> {}", 
json-diff-core/src
json-diff-core/src
Now, let's create a CLI crate to use the core library:

json-diff-cli
json-diff-cli/src
22 May 15:46
seems json-diff-cli is not finished

Augment

You're right, there's an issue with the json-diff-cli implementation. Let me fix it:

json-diff-cli/src
Now let's create a main.rs file to provide the CLI entry point:

src
The issue was that in the load_profile function, I was trying to use crate::path::JsonPath which doesn't exist in the CLI crate. I've fixed it to use the JsonPath from the core library by adding it to the imports.

Now the implementation is complete with:

A core library (json-diff-core) that handles JSON comparison and diff generation
A CLI interface (json-diff-cli) that provides command-line access to the core functionality
A workspace setup that ties everything together
The CLI allows users to:

Compare two JSON files
Apply custom comparison rules via a profile file
Output the diff to a file or stdout
22 May 15:48
add document of rules.toml design. it suppose to 1. specify json path in regex format to ignore certain fields.
2. let tool compare certain array fields without order by specify json path in regex format.

Now let's update the README.md to reference this new documentation:

The rules.toml documentation explains:

How to specify JSON paths in regex format to ignore certain fields
How to specify JSON paths for arrays that should be compared without considering order
The syntax for path specifications with examples
How to use the rules file with the tool
This documentation complements the diff format specification and provides users with a clear guide on how to customize the comparison behavior.

22 May 15:50
Give some example of unordered fields in the document

Augment
22 May 15:50
docs
I've added a new section called "Unordered Array Examples" that provides a concrete example of how the unordered array comparison works. It shows:

Two JSON documents with the same content but different array ordering
A rules.toml configuration that specifies these arrays should be compared without considering order
The expected result (no differences detected)
This example helps users understand how the unordered array comparison feature works in practice and when it might be useful.

22 May 15:53
Add unit tests

Augment
22 May 15:53
Let's add unit tests for the core functionality in the json-diff-core crate:

json-diff-core/src
Now let's add tests for the JsonPath functionality:

json-diff-core/src
Loading...
Let's also add integration tests to test the CLI functionality:

tests
Loading...
Finally, let's update the Cargo.toml to include the test dependencies:

These tests cover:

Unit tests for the core comparison functionality:
Comparing equal values
Comparing different values
Added/removed properties
Ignored paths
Unordered arrays
Nested objects
Unit tests for the JsonPath functionality:
Exact path matching
Regex path matching
Array index paths
Wildcard paths
Integration tests for the CLI:
Basic JSON comparison
Using a profile to ignore paths
The tests ensure that the core functionality works as expected and that the CLI correctly applies the rules from the profile.
